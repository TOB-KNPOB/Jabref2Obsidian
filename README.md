# Jabref2Markdown

Convert the [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org) `biblatex` repository to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) markdown notes for cross-platform viewing.

_P.S. Currently, JabRef doesn't run on iPad platform, which motivates this project._

Example scripts are stored in the `examples/` folder. Prerequisites for running the scripts are listed in `requirement.txt`. Following is a use case generating by the example script:

- JabRef Repository

- Generated Markdown pages for each entry

- Generated Markdown pages for each groups
    file structure

    Markdown layout
